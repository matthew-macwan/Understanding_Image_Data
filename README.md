# Understanding_Image_Data

### Project Summary

In this Jupyter notebook, I explain how images are read by a computer and how they are displayed. Understanding this information was vital for me when I was working on the image classification neural network and knowing how a model reads image data to make predictions on it. I wish I had something like this when I was doing my research on how to input images into a model so that it is readable so I hope this notebook can assist someone getting started with image data or machine learning projects with images.
